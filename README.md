Sleep Health and lifestyle data analysis
Description
The purpose of this data analysis is to gain insights and understand the factors influencing sleep, health, and lifestyle patterns.
By analyzing this dataset, I explore the relationships between sleep patterns, health indicators, and lifestyle factors. I analyzed the data using columns like Gender, Age ,Occupation ,Sleep_Duration, Quality_of_Sleep, Physical_Activity_Level, Stress_Level,BMI_Category, Blood_Pressure, Heart_Rate, Daily_Steps and Sleep_Disorder.
Through descriptive statistics, data visualization, and correlation analysis, we will uncover patterns and trends that can provide valuable insights into the interplay between sleep, health, and lifestyle.
This analysis has the potential to inform strategies for improving sleep quality, managing stress, enhancing physical activity, and maintaining overall well-being.
By understanding the factors affecting sleep and health, we can identify potential areas for intervention and develop targeted approaches to promote healthy sleep habits and lifestyles. The outcomes of this analysis will contribute to a deeper understanding of the relationships between sleep, health, and lifestyle factors, and ultimately support the development of evidence-based interventions for better sleep and overall well-being.
